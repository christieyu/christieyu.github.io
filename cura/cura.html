                Proposing a Semi-Generous Interface (CURA) for the Recreational Digital Browsing of Museums

            <p class="abstract">
                In 2015, digital designer and professor Mitchell Whitelaw coined the phrase "generous interface" to describe a new kind of digital interface: one that offers information at large and up front, rather than in reaction to a specific query from the user. Unlike the searchbox (which, according to Whitelaw, is like going to a museum's front desk, handing the attendant a note with a prompt, and getting back a selection of ten paintings), the generous interface overwhelms the user with more data than they could even imagine, from which the user can then take the time to make their own connections, and maybe even end up somewhere they never thought they would, unearthing new discoveries and fascinations along the way. While the generous interface is indeed magnanimous as portrayed like this, my project investigates the suitability of its application on recreational museum-browsing - whether such "generosity" really replicates the feeling of stepping into a museum, or whether there are other factors one must consider in digitizing (and recreationalizing) the museum experience holistically. After looking into the different factors of the recreational museum-goer's ideal experience, especially in consideration of the changes brought about by pandemic digitization, I propose what I call the "semi-generous interface" as a more suitable touchpoint for exploring museum content, and present the prototypes (Figma) and web app demo (node.js, Express, sqlite3) of my concept. Through this project, I attempt to strip down the museum-browsing experience to its recreational roots, while simultaneously considering the consequences and artifacts that come with digitization in deep detail.
