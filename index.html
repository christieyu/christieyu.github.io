            I’m currently a Global Future Leader at Lenovo, working from their Motorola office at Merchandise Mart in beautiful Chicago, IL. GFL is a rotational position — in my current role, I am a <span class="pink">UX architect</span>, working on defining & standardizing Lenovo’s new unified design language, <a href="http://christieyu.com/lenovo">Cake</a>, with systemic infrastructure like design patterns, tokens, pipelines, etc.
            <br><br>
            <b>I’m passionate about a lot of things when it comes to my professional work.</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>First</b>, I love working with people. I thrive in spaces where I can link diverse thoughts and solve problems with interdisciplinary teams. At the <a href="http://christieyu.com/yale-daily-news">Yale Daily News</a>, I worked with a board of 50 editors to produce output daily, speaking with people from dozens of desks in order to tie everything in a neat newspaper package at 2 a.m every night. In my first year of college, I founded <a href="http://christieyu.com/amoriem-labs">Amoriem Labs</a>, Yale’s only game development studio, which bridges programming, art, storywriting, and music talent to create original game titles. None of us — the 300+ members that came and went under my leadership, or our 9 officers — knew a thing about professional game development. We just worked together, using our knowledge from different fields to solve problems we faced, and then we figured out optimal workflow by being agile in trying new things — “failing fast” when things didn’t work out. It was a really special kind of collaborative discovery, and I treasure my memories from that time very much.
            <br><br>
            <b>Second</b>, with all the projects I have spearheaded or managed, I am in constant pursuit of efficiency and method. Whether it be establishing totally new workflows from the ground up or redesigning existing but antiquated systems, I am always thinking about ways to improve: Is this the best things can be? How can I make people’s lives easier? As a UX designer at Lenovo, these questions are always at the forefront of my thinking. When I redesign apps like <a href="http://christieyu.com/lenovo">Vantage</a>, which has over 3.3 million daily usership, I’m not just repainting it with different colors and buttons; I am actively thinking about optimizing the minutia of interactions people have to go through daily. Can I cut out the middle man? Could this wording be clarified? When I was part of the tech incubation team at <a href="http://christieyu.com/mskcc">Memoral Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>, I transitioned their entire patient survey base, with over 180k users and 1.5 million entries, into intelligent conversational format using IBM Watson. During that process, I thought very deeply about how users would interact with our tool; what the greatest pain points would be; how to communicate clearly; what kind of redundancies could be removed for them.
            <br><br>
            <b>Third</b>, what may not come as a surprise considering my passion for communication: I like to explain things to people. In summer of 2020, I put together a fundraising project called <a href="https://srsc2020.wordpress.com/">Summer Reading Series with Christie</a>, where I taught 70+ middle and high school students advanced college-level English readings for charity (we raised $26,000+ after a generous 5x match from CARE!). In the newsroom, I put together clarifying visuals for articles in a snap each night. At MSKCC, I must have created more than 10 slide decks of 50+ slides explaining things to audiences from my fellow interns to C-suite executives. And for three years I taught <a href="http://christieyu.com/cs50">CS50</a> (Introductory CS) to hundreds of people at Yale, including graduate students much older than me. Office hours were a bright part of my week; I walked people through problem sets and used all my weird life experiences – immigration law, biotechnology, game development, marketing in foreign countries – to devise kooky similes for layered CS concepts. Teaching introductory CS was something eye-opening because people of all backgrounds take it, so more often than not you need to be creative and sympathetic in how you explain complex things.
            <br><br>
            Through these experiences, I’ve thought a lot about what I want to do in life — not just big milestones I want to achieve, but how I want to live my life each day. I want to help people first and foremost, and make life easier for everyone. Nothing feels more rewarding to me than rewriting poor signage or cutting out some middle software from a daily work process! I want to talk to many people and meet many people every single day; I want to learn new concepts from wildly different disciplines and distill them for other people to understand; I want to solve problems and do it collaboratively, bridging talent from different backgrounds and listening to the needs of every team member.
            <br><br>
