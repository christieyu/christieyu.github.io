			<p class="text-5">Hello, I'm <span style="color:#ec008c">Christie</span>. I am a junior at Yale University studying Computer Science and English.</p>
			<div style="padding:1%"></div>
			<div id="containerleft">
					<p class="text-3">This summer, I worked as a Tech Incubation intern for <span style="color:#ec008c">
						Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s</span> Digital department, exploring IBM Watson 
						as a platform for conversationalizing patient surveys. I discovered a few things about myself there.<br><br>
						First, I love working with people — speaking with stakeholders, collaborating with teammates, 
						clarifying success metrics — all of this thrilled me. 
						I’ve noticed that I thrive in spaces where I can bridge people or teams and learn how to solve 
						problems as a group. At the <a href="/portfolio/yale-daily-news" style="color:#ec008c">Yale Daily News</a>, I work with a 
						board of 50 editors to produce something at the end of every day, 
						speaking with people from dozens of desks in order to tie everything together in a neat newspaper 
						package at 2 a.m. I founded <a href="portfolio/amoriem-labs" style="color:#ec008c">Amoriem Labs</a>, Yale’s only game development 
						team 1.5 years ago, which bridges programming, art, and music talent to create beautiful, 
						interdisciplinary projects. None of us know a thing about professional gamedev — we just worked 
						together to solve problems we faced and figured out optimal workflow by being bold in trying new things. 
						I love this kind of collaborative creation and discovery; everywhere I go, I try to build 
						cross-discipline, balanced team efforts so we can create something productive at the end of the day.<br><br>

						I also discovered that I like explaining things to people — not through MSKCC, but through a 
						fundraising project I put together this summer called <a href="https://srsc2020.wordpress.com/" style="color:#ec008c">
						Summer Reading Series with Christie</a>, 
						where I taught 70+ middle and high school students advanced college-level English readings for charity 
						(we raised $26,000+ after a generous 5x match from CARE!). It's why I’ve always been drawn 
						(pun unintended) to graphic design. In the newsroom, I have to put together clarifying visuals 
						for articles in a snap each night. 
						At MSKCC, I must have created more than 10 slide decks of 50+ slides explaining things to audiences from 
						my fellow interns to high-level company executives. And for two years now I’ve taught 
						<a href="/portfolio/cs50" style="color:#ec008c">CS50</a> (Introductory CS) to hundreds of people at Yale. 
						Office hours are a bright part of my week, where I can walk people through problem sets and 
						use all my weird field experiences (immigration law, biotechnology, game development, marketing 
						in foreign countries) as well as my English major to devise wild similes for layered CS concepts. 
						Teaching introductory CS is something special because people of all backgrounds take it, so 
						more often than not you need to be creative and sympathetic in how you explain basic things.<br><br>

						Through these experiences, I’ve thought a lot about what I want to do in life — not just big 
						milestones I want to achieve, but how I want to live my life each day. I want to help people 
						first and foremost. 
						Nothing felt more rewarding than creating solutions for cancer patients. I want to talk to many 
						people and meet many people every single day. I want to learn new concepts from wildly different 
						disciplines and distill them for other people to understand. 
						I want to solve problems and do it collaboratively, bridging talent from different backgrounds 
						and listening to the needs of all team members.<br><br>

						Thank you for taking the time to get to know a little bit about me and my projects. I'm always happy 
						to chat! Say hello at <a href="christie.yu@yale.edu" style="color:#ec008c">christie.yu@yale.edu</span>!</p>
