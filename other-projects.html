					At Yale, working for the YDN is not an activity — it is a way of living. Our passionate, meticulous, tireless managing editors are at production at least 40 hours a week (a full-time job commitment!) while desk editors linger in the building long past their four-hour nightly shifts to finish up homework and engage in heated debates over the latest controversy in journalism. You'll find signs of life at 202 York St. at all hours, from our staff running in before sunrise to distribute papers, to (alas) Production and Design editors staying past 4 a.m. to ensure the safe delivery of PDF's to our printer in Hartford. And since we're eponymously a <i>daily</i> paper, no editor can ever drop the ball.<br><br>
					Our dedication shows: last year, we were announced "<a href="https://www.spj.org/moe18.asp" target="_blank"><u>Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper</u></a>" by the Society of Professional Journalists!
