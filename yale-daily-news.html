						At Yale, working for the YDN is not an activity â€” it is a lifestyle. Our passionate, meticulous, tireless managing editors are at production at least 40 hours a week (a full-time job commitment!) while desk editors linger in the building long past their four-hour nightly shifts to finish up homework and engage in heated debates over the latest controversy in journalism. You'll find signs of life at 202 York St. at all hours, from our staff running in before sunrise to distribute papers, to (alas) Production and Design editors staying past 4 a.m. to ensure the safe delivery of PDF's to our printer in Hartford. And since we're eponymously a <i>daily</i> paper, no editor can ever drop the ball.<br><br>
						Our dedication shows: last year, we were announced "<a href="https://www.spj.org/moe18.asp" target="_blank"><u>Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper</u></a>" by the Society of Professional Journalists!

						I'm a <span style="color:#ec008c">Production and Design editor</span> on the Yale Daily News Managing Board of 2021. P&D is responsible for producing daily spreads for our different sections: A-section (the daily paper), WKND (the creative insert we publish Fridays), and Magazine (our bimonthly foray into long-form journalism). We use software such as <span style="color:#ec008c">Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Bridge, and InCopy</span>, and rely on a central management system called vjoon K4.<br><br>

						We are also tasked with creating special issues such as weekly 6-page "Week in Review" issues published on Saturdays and sold to alumni, an annual 10-page issue for the Harvard-Yale football game, two 60-page issues for Commencement and incoming first-years, and an 8-page issue publishing work from our Summer Journalism Program for high school students.<br><br>

						Since this year there are six P&D editors (compared to last year's nine), we each come in about 25 hours a week, divided into one "lead" A-section shift where we oversee the full production night and multiple "support" shifts for A-section and other categories.<br><br>

						I personally oversee A-section, Weekend, and special issue production. I was one of twelve YDN staffers to stay two weeks past finals period to organize, manage, and design a 60-page <a href="images/ydn/commencement.pdf" target="_blank"><u>commencement issue</u></a>.<br>

						Creating 60 pages of content in 14 days involves amazing quantities of preparation. Our typical workflow for every single article includes content planning, writing, desk editing, fact-checking, editing from management, copy-editing, layout, proofing, and printing. <br>

						The P&D desk is unique in that, barring management, we are really the only desk that interacts with every other desk at the YDN. Articles, photographs, illustrations, graphics, corrections, ads, our Youtube videos, our website, our social media... we see it all!<br><br>
						We on P&D sometimes joke that P&D drives the YDN's content. This is because, as the last step of production, we are often called upon to fill space when an article has to be pushed or dropped, leaving us with not enough content for the next day. In that case, we work under significant time pressure to produce graphics from data handed to us from desk editors using Adobe Illustrator. <br>

						Outside of production, I also co-directed this summer's <span style="color:#ec008c">Summer Journalism Program</span>, which is a weeklong crash course on journalism for local high school students hosted at our production building the week before fall term begins. After planning and executing a core curriculum of story angle, sourcing, writing, structuring, fact-checking, copy-editing, photography, and production skills, we paired students to write articles for an 8-page paper, which I created and sent to them the day after the program ended.<br><br>

						The program raised over $8,000 for the YDN's yearly operating budget thanks to the intensive outreach to local high schools we put into play this year. We were also responsible for reading, organizing, and responding to student applications as well as planning and directing all program activities.<br><br>

						To supplement each day's lessons, we reached out and got renowned YDN alum (including <span style="color:#ec008c">Michael Barbaro</span>, host of The New York Times podcast <i>The Daily</i>, <span style="color:#ec008c">Max Abelson</span>, Wall Street reporter for Bloomberg, and <span style="color:#ec008c">Caroline Chen</span>, health care investigative reporter for ProPublica) to host a daily speaker series. <br>

						My most recent project at the YDN was planning, managing, and making a 10-page issue for the Harvard-Yale football game with our sports editors. Thanks to our careful workflow planning and our consideration of limited human resources (we published this Friday, meaning Thursday night we had to produce 32 pages for A-section, Weekend and this issue), we were able to crank this issue out in less than seven hours. <br>

						I enjoy both management and design aspects of creating full issues. As I prepare more special issues with interesting parameters, I learn more about the unique processes of each desk. I am passionate about optimizing not just mine but every desk's workflow so that we as a board can become more efficient, without sacrificing the quality of our content or design.<br><br>
