                    At Yale, working for the YDN is not an activity — it is a lifestyle. Our passionate, meticulous, tireless managing editors are at production at least 40 hours a week (a full-time job commitment!) while desk editors linger in the building long past their four-hour nightly shifts to finish up homework and engage in heated debates over the latest controversy in journalism. You'll find signs of life at 202 York St. at all hours, from our staff running in before sunrise to distribute papers, to (alas) Production and Design editors staying past 4 a.m. to ensure the safe delivery of PDF's to our printer in Hartford. And since we're eponymously a <i>daily</i> paper, no editor can ever drop the ball.<br><br>
                    Our dedication shows: last year, we were announced "<a href="https://www.spj.org/moe18.asp" target="_blank"><u>Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper</u></a>" by the Society of Professional Journalists!

                    I'm a <span style="color:#ec008c">Production and Design editor</span> on the Yale Daily News Managing Board of 2021. P&D is responsible for producing daily spreads for our different sections: A-section (the daily paper), WKND (the creative insert we publish Fridays), and Magazine (our bimonthly foray into long-form journalism). We use software such as <span style="color:#ec008c">Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Bridge, and InCopy</span>, and rely on a central management system called vjoon K4.<br><br>

                    We are also tasked with creating special issues such as weekly 6-page "Week in Review" issues published on Saturdays and sold to alumni, an annual 10-page issue for the Harvard-Yale football game, two 60-page issues for Commencement and incoming first-years, and an 8-page issue publishing work from our Summer Journalism Program for high school students.<br><br>

                    Since this year there are six P&D editors (compared to last year's nine), we each come in about 25 hours a week, divided into one "lead" A-section shift where we oversee the full production night and multiple "support" shifts for A-section and other categories.<br><br>

                    I personally oversee A-section, Weekend, and special issue production. I was one of twelve YDN staffers to stay two weeks past finals period to organize, manage, and design a 60-page <a href="images/ydn/commencement.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Commencement issue</u></a>.<br>

                    The P&D desk is unique in that, barring management, we are really the only desk that interacts with every other desk at the YDN. Articles, photographs, illustrations, graphics, corrections, ads, our Youtube videos, our website, our social media... we see it all!<br><br>
                    We on P&D sometimes joke that P&D drives the YDN's content. This is because, as the last step of production, we are often called upon to fill space when an article has to be pushed or dropped, leaving us with not enough content for the next day. In that case, we work under some pretty hefty time pressure to produce graphics from data handed to us from desk editors using Adobe Illustrator. <br>

                    Outside of production, I also co-directed this summer's <span style="color:#ec008c">Summer Journalism Program</span>, which is a weeklong crash course on journalism for local high school students hosted at our production building the week before fall term begins. After planning and executing a core curriculum of story angle, sourcing, writing, structuring, fact-checking, copy-editing, photography, and production skills, we paired students to write articles for an 8-page paper, which I created and sent to them the day after the program ended.<br><br>

                    The program raised over $8,000 for the YDN's yearly operating budget thanks to the intensive outreach to local high schools we put into play this year. We were also responsible for reading, organizing, and responding to student applications as well as planning and directing all program activities.<br><br>

                    To supplement each day's lessons, we reached out and got renowned YDN alum (including <span style="color:#ec008c">Michael Barbaro</span>, host of The New York Times podcast <i>The Daily</i>, <span style="color:#ec008c">Max Abelson</span>, Wall Street reporter for Bloomberg, and <span style="color:#ec008c">Caroline Chen</span>, health care investigative reporter for ProPublica) to host a daily speaker series. <br>

                    I love both design and management aspects of creating full issues, and I truly enjoy the (sometimes tedious) tasks of copy-editing and proofing pages. As I prepare more special issues with interesting parameters, I learn more about the unique processes of each desk. I am passionate about optimizing not just mine but every desk's workflow so that each night's production can grow more efficient, without ever sacrificing the quality of our content or design.<br><br>

                <div>
                    <p class="text-3">
                        With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our existing workflows could not continue to exist. Myself, along with my fellow Production & Design Editors, Management, and members of our Tech team, oversaw our transition to a functional remote model, complete with collaborative communication channels to replace the irreplaceable vibe of 202 York St.<br><br>

                        I personally oversaw our transition from K4, a content management system by Dutch company vjoon, to a hybrid model of Google Suite, an Amazon Web Server, Slack, and shared Indesign templates, paragraph styles, and export settings, just to tide us over the remaining period of our editorship. During that time period, I realized a number of changes the YDN needed to make to keep up with our equivalents at other colleges, as well as to elevate our coverage to more professional standards.<br><br>

                        In particular, upon moving to a daily online and weekly print paper model to conserve finances, we lost a great deal of our publication strength, relying on an old, messy website codebase for our only daily content platform, as well as losing our regular touchpoint with our demographic — our Yale campus distribution sites. We needed to make rapid and vast improvement to our digital channels (web, social media, mobile app) in order to keep our readership and maintain our existing campus presence. Not to mention, our communication channels which had tided us over the last months of my old editorship would not last what might be another semester or even another year, especially to facilitate the kind of cross-desk multimedia projects we were envisioning.<br><br>

                        Myself, along with a few other outgoing board members, formed the inaugural Digital Desk in response to these areas of obvious improvement. We set together some goals for our desk's <span style="color:#ec008c">2020-21 projects:</span><br><br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helping desk editors set up digital <span style="color:#ec008c">workflow and communication systems</span> </li>
                        <li>Transforming our <span style="color:#ec008c">web style</span> through adding inline and interactive content </li>
                        <li>Curating creative multimedia content specific to our <span style="color:#ec008c">social media channels</span> for greater audience engagement</li>
                        <li>Launching the <span style="color:#ec008c">Yale Daily News app</span> as a new touchpoint for digital News readers</li>
                        <li>Investigating alternate content presentation on the <span style="color:#ec008c">newsletter</span></li>
                        <li>Investing time into understanding <span style="color:#ec008c">our readership’s user experience</span> to improve digital interfaces</li>
                        <li>Collaborating with the Publisher to <span style="color:#ec008c">monetize digital content</span></li>

                        I can't wait to launch these projects with my fellow editors, since, with talent from Photo, Video, Podcast, Design, Data, and newsroom desks, we'll be able to plan, timeline, oversee, and delegate many long-form and multimedia journalism content that the YDN desperately needs. With new tools such as <span style="color:#ec008c">Adobe Spark, Adobe XD, Buffer social media CMS, Wordpress, Microsoft Teams, and Trello</span> at our fingertips, our team is ready to tackle the multimedia challenges YDN has been too overloaded to devote time to yet. And, as returning editors, we'll be able to advise incoming editors on how to navigate these peculiar journalistic times and guide tough ethical and operational decisions.<br><br>
