							At Yale, working for the YDN is not an activity â€” it is a lifestyle. Our passionate, meticulous, tireless managing editors are at production at least 40 hours a week (a full-time job commitment!) while desk editors linger in the building long past their four-hour nightly shifts to finish up homework and engage in heated debates over the latest controversy in journalism. You'll find signs of life at 202 York St. at all hours, from our staff running in before sunrise to distribute papers, to (alas) Production and Design editors staying past 4 a.m. to ensure the safe delivery of PDF's to our printer in Hartford. And since we're eponymously a <i>daily</i> paper, no editor can ever drop the ball.<br><br>
							Our dedication shows: last year, we were announced "<a href="https://www.spj.org/moe18.asp" target="_blank">Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper</a>" by the Society of Professional Journalists!

							I'm a <span style="color:#ec008c">Production and Design editor</span> on the Yale Daily News Managing Board of 2021. P&D is responsible for producing daily spreads for our different sections: A-section (the daily paper), WKND (the creative insert we publish Fridays), and Magazine (our bimonthly foray into long-form journalism). We use software such as <span style="color:#ec008c">Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Bridge, and InCopy</span>, and rely on a central management system called vjoon K4.<br><br>

							We are also tasked with creating special issues such as weekly "Week in Review" issues published on Saturdays and sold to alumni, an annual 12-page issue for the Harvard-Yale football game, two 60-page issues for Commencement and incoming first-years, and an 8-page issue publishing work from our Summer Journalism Program for high school students.<br><br>

							Since this year there are six P&D editors (compared to last year's nine), we each come in about 25 hours a week, divided into one "lead" A-section shift where we oversee the full production night and multiple "support" shifts for A-section and other categories.<br><br>

							I personally oversee A-section, Weekend, and special issue production. I was part of twelve YDN staffers to stay two weeks past finals period to organize, manage, and design a 60-page <a href="images/ydn/commencement.pdf" target="_blank">commencement issue</a>.<br>

							To create 60 pages of content in 14 days involves amazing quantities of preparation. Our typical workflow for every single article includes content planning, writing, desk editing, fact-checking, editing from management, copy-editing, layout, proofing, and printing. <br>

							The P&D desk is unique in that, barring management, we are really the only desk that interacts with every other desk at the YDN. Articles, photographs, illustrations, graphics, corrections, ads, our Youtube videos, our website, our social media... we see it all!<br><br>
							We on P&D sometimes joke that P&D drives the YDN's content. This is because, as the last step of production, we are often called upon to fill space when an article has to be pushed or dropped, leaving us with not enough content for the next day. In that case, we work under significant time pressure to produce graphics from data handed to us from desk editors using Adobe Illustrator. <br>
