							At Yale, it's not uncommon to hear about how the YDN can suck away students' lives. In some ways it's true: our passionate, meticulous, tireless managing editors are at 202 York St at least 40 hours a week (a full-time job commitment!). You'll find signs of life at 202 York St. at all hours, from our staff running in before sunrise to distribute papers, to — alas — Production and Design editors staying past 4 a.m. to ensure the safe delivery of PDF's to our printer in Hartford. And since we're eponymously a <i>daily</i> paper, the ball can never drop.<br></p>

We sent our 12-page paper to print at 1:25 a.m., a record in YDN's history of first nights! You can find me in a yellow sweater in the back. The girl in the beige hoodie on the right is our amazing Editor-in-Chief, Sammy Westfall!</i></figcaption>

							I'm a <span style="color:#ec008c">Production and Design editor</span> on the Yale Daily News Managing Board of 2021. P&D is responsible for producing daily spreads for our different sections: A-section (the daily paper), WKND (the creative insert we publish Fridays), and Magazine (our bimonthly foray into long-form journalism).<br><br>
							We are also tasked with creating special issues such as an annual 12-page issue for the Harvard-Yale football game, two 60-page issues for Commencement and incoming first-years, and an 8-page issue publishing work from our Summer Journalism Program for high school students.<br><br>
